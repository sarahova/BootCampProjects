# 14 D3.js - Bootcamp Assignment 

## Background

D3.js was very tricky. Writing code involving svgs is not that intuitive. But man are those animations soo cool!

This assignment was about analyzing health risks facing particular demographics. 

The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: [https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml). The data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."

### Final graph
