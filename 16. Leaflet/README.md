# 16 Web Mapping (Leaflet) - Bootcamp Assignment 

## Background

This was a web mapping assignment where we used Leaflet.js. The assignment was to plot earthquake markers on a global map. The earthquake data was from [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php). We ploted 'All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days'. 

### Final Map

The final map should include:

 * Data markers that reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and darker in color.

 * Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

* Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.

* Plot a second data set on our map (i.e. fault lines or tectonic plate boundaries)

* Add a number of base maps to choose from as well as separate out our two different data sets into overlays that can be turned on and off independently.

* Add layer controls to our map.
